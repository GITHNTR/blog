Like something to be honest was something I would never do.\nI submitted my very first CFP (and now several since). For me, this was both something\nthat terrified me as well as a goal for 2020. I never thought I would get to a point where\nI felt \"smart enough\" to give a talk at a conference. I decided to not let \"imposter syndrome\"\nrule my life anymore and be confident in the knowledge I've gained through being an everyday\nprogrammer.</p>\n<h3>Now What?</h3>\n<p>Even though I submitted a talk, it most certainly doesn't guarentee me that I'll be selected\nto give the talk. I plan to continue to submit my talk untill someone picks me! I do not expect\nto be perfect or to give the talk of a seasoned vet, but I do expect to take the first step. You\nsee we often compare ourselves to people who have specialized in an area for many many years.\nUltimately the only thing we can do is to take the step direclty in front of us. So I chose\nto tackle my fears and take that step. Only time will tell how it will pay off, but I look\nforward to hearing back and ultimatley giving my very first \"official\" talk in 2020.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 16, 2020","path":"/blog/2020/my-first-cfp","title":"I Submitted My First Talk!","videoUrl":null}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
