Nevertheless when the opportunity presented itself to join Briebug, a top Angular consulting company; I just couldn't pass it by. My first client is Sirius XM, where I will be serving as an Angular lead for the Phoenix project; Team Einstein. Though their is yet another steep learning curve ahead of me, I am excited for the opportunity to help yet another amazing organization.
