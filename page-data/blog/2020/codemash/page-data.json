This year,\nlike every year was an amazing experience. I was able to reconnect with\nso many old friends and even make some new ones. CodeMash in my opinion\nis one of the top regional tech conferences. You know you will get\na lot of \"bang for your buck\" every time you attend CodeMash. At just $300,\nit is affordable for anyone who wants to come to the 2 day all inclusive\nconference. </p>\n<h3>Pro's:</h3>\n<img src=\"https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/82545411_618840511991401_2572299580506898432_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=EwNP8-u1MlkAX8mSs7G&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&oh=370ecd831bdc91bfe2d922e43df848de&oe=5EDB7256\" class=\"image right\" alt=\"Jordan Powell at CodeMash 2020\" />\n<p>CodeMash offers several different learning tracks (I believe 5). This wasn't\nthe case in it's early years but was recently changed to provide valuable\nlearning for people of all experiences and titles within the dev space. So whether\nyour primarily role is a dev (frontend or backend), dev-ops, testing, or even a manager\ntheir is both a track and talks tailed to helping you better your career. CodeMash Conference\nalso does an amazing job of providing value and entertainment extending\npast the day sessions. From the exclusive pool party in the famouse Kalahari Waterpark, to\nthe family friendly games and entertainment it has something for everyone. </p>\n<p>The conference organizers also do an amazing job of catering to the needs of it's attendees.\nThey provide meals for all of those with dietery restraints and event provide free shuttles\nfor those staying off campus.</p>\n<h3>Con's:</h3>\n<p>My biggest complain is that you are only able to stay at the Kalahari Resort if you stay\nfor the 4 day's (2 days of workshops and the 2 day conference). Though they do their\nbest to provide commuting from off campus as simple as possible with their shuttle tracker\napp along with free shuttle service, it still doesn't beat the convenience of staying\nat the Kalahari itself.</p>\n<h3>Learning Take Away's</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Vertical Slices Are Awesome</strong> - I started using this pattern and Jimmy Bogard's talk reassured my thoughts on the pattern even more. </li>\n<li><strong>Cory FREAKING House</strong> -  ALWAYS gives a great talk</li>\n<li><strong>ViewJs</strong> - is the perfect framework for newbies</li>\n<li><strong>React</strong> - is still awesome and used by A LOT of teams</li>\n<li><strong>Bold Penguine</strong> - is such an inspiring company</li>\n<li><strong>Consulting</strong> - I can't wait to do this fulltime</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 20, 2020","path":"/blog/2020/codemash","title":"CodeMash 2020","videoUrl":null}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
