I will never forget when I saw Cypress for the very first time at <a href=\"https://stirtrek.com/\">Stir Trek</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/digitaldrummerj\">Justin James</a> was giving a talk and I remember just thinking how cool this tool was. Little did I know I would have the opportunity to get to come work on this amazing tool just a few years later. See, life is interesting like this in that in hindsight I find most things make total sense. Yet, we spend so much energy dwelling and worrying about the present and future.</p>\n<p>I would be remiss if I didn't give some context as to why I left Briebug and why I took the job at Cypress. First of all, I want to say a humongous thank you to the folks at Briebug. From the leadership, Jesse, Dave and Kevin, to my mentor Jon Rista, I can't thank you all enough. You were nothing but kind to me and I will forever be appreciative for taking a chance on me and letting me live the dream I had of doing Angular consulting. In my time (just under a year) I learned soooo much that really empowered me to grow into the engineer I am today. With that being said, I was starting to get burned out. I have enough self awareness to know this about my self. Therefore, when the opportunity to potentially make a change to Cypress came, I decided I would entertain the opportunity and ultimately after much prayer, decided to accept the position. After almost 2 months into my new role at Cypress I can confirm that so far the change has been everything I hoped it would be and then some.</p>\n<h3>About Cypress</h3>\n<p>Web development has advanced in leaps and bounds in the last decade, but front-end testing has not. Testing sucks. It’s the part that every developer dreads.</p>\n<p>It’s often harder to write a passing test than an actual feature.</p>\n<p>We want to spend our time building cool things, and we need tools that match how we build modern applications.</p>\n<p>So we built a revolutionary new testing tool from the ground up. We have created a product that we love and actually use ourselves.</p>\n<p>Our team is highly experienced and passionate about solving problems. We’re lucky enough to have some of the best minds in the industry.</p>\n<p>Being open source, Cypress is evolving faster and better than if we worked on it alone.</p>\n<p>Now developers can ship their software faster and more consistently, with confidence.</p>\n<p>We believe testing needs a lot of love, and we are here to foster a tool, a service, and a community that can teach and benefit everyone.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 13, 2021","path":"/blog/2021/im-joining-cypress","title":"I'm Joining Cypress","videoUrl":null}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
