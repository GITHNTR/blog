I will never forget when I saw Cypress for the very first time at <a href="https://stirtrek.com/">Stir Trek</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/digitaldrummerj">Justin James</a> was giving a talk and I remember just thinking how cool this tool was. Little did I know I would have the opportunity to get to come work on this amazing tool just a few years later. See, life is interesting like this in that in hindsight I find most things make total sense. Yet, we spend so much energy dwelling and worrying about the present and future.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn't give some context as to why I left Briebug and why I took the job at Cypress. First of all, I want to say a humongous thank you to the folks at Briebug. From the leadership, Jesse, Dave and Kevin, to my mentor Jon Rista, I can't thank you all enough. You were nothing but kind to me and I will forever be appreciative for taking a chance on me and letting me live the dream I had of doing Angular consulting. In my time (just under a year) I learned soooo much that really empowered me to grow into the engineer I am today. With that being said, I was starting to get burned out. I have enough self awareness to know this about my self. Therefore, when the opportunity to potentially make a change to Cypress came, I decided I would entertain the opportunity and ultimately after much prayer, decided to accept the position. After almost 2 months into my new role at Cypress I can confirm that so far the change has been everything I hoped it would be and then some.</p>
<h3>About Cypress</h3>
<p>Web development has advanced in leaps and bounds in the last decade, but front-end testing has not. Testing sucks. It’s the part that every developer dreads.</p>
<p>It’s often harder to write a passing test than an actual feature.</p>
<p>We want to spend our time building cool things, and we need tools that match how we build modern applications.</p>
<p>So we built a revolutionary new testing tool from the ground up. We have created a product that we love and actually use ourselves.</p>
<p>Our team is highly experienced and passionate about solving problems. We’re lucky enough to have some of the best minds in the industry.</p>
<p>Being open source, Cypress is evolving faster and better than if we worked on it alone.</p>
<p>Now developers can ship their software faster and more consistently, with confidence.</p>
<p>We believe testing needs a lot of love, and we are here to foster a tool, a service, and a community that can teach and benefit everyone.</p></div><a class="button small icon solid fa-chevron-left" href="/blog">Back To Blog</a></div></section></article></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/blog/2021/im-joining-cypress";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-1a2e57782b1e35f1f124.js"],"app":["/app-0ad98e37e5e6844cd2b2.js"],"component---node-modules-gatsby-plugin-offline-app-shell-js":["/component---node-modules-gatsby-plugin-offline-app-shell-js-0f40d706ebc58d78c1f6.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-f21aaa73de4b20f7d55b.js"],"component---src-pages-blog-js":["/component---src-pages-blog-js-0f6860a5110f1e02d298.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-ae521135a624f2ab3a03.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-template-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-template-js-9594e502097cd38e0d1e.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-1a2e57782b1e35f1f124.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-blog-template-js-9594e502097cd38e0d1e.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-0ad98e37e5e6844cd2b2.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-741ade27086b2708e961.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-a998673b86391eca03ce.js" async=""></script></body></html>
