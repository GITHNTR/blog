However, with so many young people their are A LOT of kids everywhere. 75% of homes are single mothers who find them selves each day working just to bring enough food home to keep their family alive. This means that their teenagers, kids, toddlers and even infants are left fending for themselves. These are some of the things that are almost impossible for most of us in America to even fatham."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"I also know that despite the challenges it faces, the work we are doing in Honduras is REALLY working!
