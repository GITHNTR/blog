I wanted to thank DevTeam504 for the opportunity to speak on Cypress Best Practices at your monthly meetup. You all were so kind to me and made me feel right at home. Plus you know that Honduras holds a special place in my heart.

This talk was inspired by our [Best Practices reference guide](<(https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices)>) in the Cypress Docs
