title: "I'm Joining Cypress"
---

I am proud to announce that I have officially accepted a position as a Developer Experience (DX) Engineer with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). I will never forget when I saw Cypress for the very first time at [Stir Trek](https://stirtrek.com/). [Justin James](https://twitter.com/digitaldrummerj) was giving a talk and I remember just thinking how cool this tool was. Little did I know I would have the opportunity to get to come work on this amazing tool just a few years later. See, life is interesting like this in that in hindsight I find most things make total sense. Yet, we spend so much energy dwelling and worrying about the present and future.

I would be remiss if I didn't give some context as to why I left Briebug and why I took the job at Cypress. First of all, I want to say a humongous thank you to the folks at Briebug. From the leadership, Jesse, Dave and Kevin, to my mentor Jon Rista, I can't thank you all enough. You were nothing but kind to me and I will forever be appreciative for taking a chance on me and letting me live the dream I had of doing Angular consulting. In my time (just under a year) I learned soooo much that really empowered me to grow into the engineer I am today. With that being said, I was starting to get burned out. I have enough self awareness to know this about my self. Therefore, when the opportunity to potentially make a change to Cypress came, I decided I would entertain the opportunity and ultimately after much prayer, decided to accept the position. After almost 2 months into my new role at Cypress I can confirm that so far the change has been everything I hoped it would be and then some.

### About Cypress

Web development has advanced in leaps and bounds in the last decade, but front-end testing has not. Testing sucks. It’s the part that every developer dreads.

It’s often harder to write a passing test than an actual feature.

We want to spend our time building cool things, and we need tools that match how we build modern applications.

So we built a revolutionary new testing tool from the ground up. We have created a product that we love and actually use ourselves.

Our team is highly experienced and passionate about solving problems. We’re lucky enough to have some of the best minds in the industry.

Being open source, Cypress is evolving faster and better than if we worked on it alone.

Now developers can ship their software faster and more consistently, with confidence.

We believe testing needs a lot of love, and we are here to foster a tool, a service, and a community that can teach and benefit everyone.
