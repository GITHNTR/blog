### Inspiration

I just finished yet another series graphic for my [Church](https://limafirst.church). With this graphic, I wanted something that said `FREEDOM` but emotionally implied nothing but that. Often times the things we think of in life that bring us Freedom are the very things that hold us captive.

### Reflection
What are things, people, or places that you call free that really are not?
