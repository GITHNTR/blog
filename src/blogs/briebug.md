I am proud to announce that I have officially accepted a position as a Senior Enterprise Software Engineer with [Briebug](https://briebug.com/). For many years it has been my dream to do consulting. It has been something my wife and I have been praying about for a long time. I honestly thought it was at the very leasty 5 - 10 years down the road. Nevertheless when the opportunity presented itself to join Briebug, a top Angular consulting company; I just couldn't pass it by. My first client is Sirius XM, where I will be serving as an Angular lead for the Phoenix project; Team Einstein. Though their is yet another steep learning curve ahead of me, I am excited for the opportunity to help yet another amazing organization. There are countless number of people who have helped me get to where I am today. You all know who you are and I hope you know how appreciative I am for you. I would not be where I am today without you all.
